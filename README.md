# Professional-Readme-To-Go
  
  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)


  ## Description:
  My motivation for this project was to be able to generate a readme using node.js. This helped to understand the inquirer package. Also helped with exporting files and finding a new way to use functions, objects, and arrays in JavaScript. This solves being able to generate ReadMeâ€™s on command. This skips lots of steps in editing a Readme if everything is written out. I learned how to use node.js and all its capabilities.
